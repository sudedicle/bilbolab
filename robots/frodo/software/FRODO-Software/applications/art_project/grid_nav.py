# =====================================================================================
#  Robot-independent grid path planning for the art project.
#
#  The floor is a rectangular grid of nodes (each node = one ArUco marker, see
#  CITY_MAP in art_project_frodo.py). A robot can only travel along grid edges
#  (4-connected: N/S/E/W) and only turns +-90 degrees at a node.
#
#  shortest_path() does a breadth-first search from start to goal. Optionally a
#  set of "blocked" nodes can be given (e.g. the cell another robot is sitting
#  on / driving through) - BFS then routes around them. Because every edge costs
#  the same, BFS already returns a minimum-length path.
#
#  Nothing here touches hardware or the camera, so it can be unit-tested on any
#  machine:  python -m applications.art_project.grid_nav
