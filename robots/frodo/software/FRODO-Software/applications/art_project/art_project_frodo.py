#  FRODO - Line Following + ArUco Grid Navigation
#
#  WiFi command surface matches hoca's host-side protocol (see
#  software/robots/frodo/applications/artproject/application_artproject.py):
#  go_to_position, stop, get_pose, get_status - names/payloads kept 1:1 compatible so
#  ArtProject_Application/ArtProject_FRODO on the host can drive this robot unchanged.
#  trigger_servo is an extra, FRODO-specific command (no host-side equivalent - the
#  metronome servo also triggers automatically off ArUco IDs, see SERVO_TRIGGER_IDS).
#
#  Navigation itself is still grid/line-based (not free x,y driving), so
#  go_to_position() snaps the requested world (x, y) to the nearest known grid node
#  and reuses the existing turn-by-turn navigation - see world_to_grid_node() below.

# --- ARUCO FILTERS ---
# The DECISION (direction/target) is made as soon as a marker is ACCEPTED - but
# it isn't APPLIED right away, the robot first drives straight for ADVANCE_TIME
# (see ADVANCING_TO_TURN/PARKING below). These two solve different problems:
# decisions used to be made way too early, because ARUCO_Y_MIN=0.15 was loose
# enough that a marker got ACCEPTED while still in the middle of the path
# (observed in the field: decided at size~80-100px, even though a marker at an
# intersection could grow to 150-170px) - fixed by adding a hard floor on pixel
# SIZE (ARUCO_MIN_SIZE_PX). The decision now fires at the right time, but the
# robot may not physically be at the exact center of the intersection/marker yet
# - that last step is finished by ADVANCE_TIME (driving straight open-loop,
# WITHOUT looking at the image).

# In FOLLOWING (a plain pass-through node, not the final target), a hard stop
# the instant the line is lost can permanently strand the robot: an ArUco card
# sitting on/near the line increasingly covers it as the robot gets close,
# which can lose the line just short of ARUCO_MIN_SIZE_PX (observed in the
# field: marker size froze at ~. 145px, just under the 160px accept threshold,
# because the robot fully stopped instead of creeping the last bit forward).
# Creep straight open-loop for a bit first - either the line reappears past
# the marker, or the marker grows enough to be ACCEPTED - before giving up
# and actually stopping.

ARUCO_LOG_PERIOD = 0.5     # log a marker at most twice per second

# --- CLOSED-LOOP TURNING (EKF psi feedback) ---
# Instead of a blind timed turn, we turn a relative +-TURN_ANGLE from whatever
# psi actually reads when the turn starts, with a PI controller (see the
# turn-start block below for why this is relative rather than an absolute
# EAST=0/NORTH=90/.. target - psi is odometry-only and drifts over a
# multi-leg run).
# TURN_ANGLE is NOT 90deg on purpose: field-measured actual rotation for a
# commanded 90deg came out ~85deg (RADIUS calibration still undershoots a
# bit), so we command more than a true right angle to compensate. Re-measure
# with a protractor/compass after changing this and adjust again if needed.
TURN_ANGLE = np.radians(105.0)   # commanded relative turn per grid turn
TURN_KP = 1.6               # rad/s per rad of error - bumped up, turn was too gentle and lost the line
TURN_KI = 0.4                # integral gain - overcomes friction/static error
TURN_I_LIMIT = 0.5           # clamp on the integral term's contribution (rad/s)
TURN_OMEGA_MAX = 1.4         # max angular speed allowed while turning (rad/s)
TURN_TOLERANCE = np.radians(4.0)   # tolerance for "reached the target"
TURN_SETTLE_TIME = 0.15      # stay within tolerance this long before calling the turn done (noise rejection)

# After a turn/park decision is made, the robot keeps driving STRAIGHT (WITHOUT
# looking at the image) for this long, open-loop - so it ends up at the exact
# center of the intersection/marker. Now that ARUCO_MIN_SIZE_PX already makes the
# decision fire close to the intersection (fixed the old "turning too early"
# issue), this short advance is safe: since it never looks at the image at all,
# there's no risk of intersection/marker contours steering line-following the
# wrong way (the old design used line-following here and that caused a "two-step"
# wobble).
