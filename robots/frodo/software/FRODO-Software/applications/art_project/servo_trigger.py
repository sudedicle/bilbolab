# =====================================================================================
#  Robot-independent helper: triggers a servo move when certain ArUco IDs are seen
#  (e.g. opening a lid, waving a flag, dropping a brush).
#
#  Only needs a Servo/HardwareServo object (with a setAngle(angle, settle_time)
#  method) and a "drive(v_left, v_right)" callback - nothing FRODO-specific here,
#  so this works unchanged on other robots too (with a different servo pin / drive
#  function).
#
#  TWO WAYS TO USE THIS:
#   1) check_and_run() - simple, ONE call does everything (approach -> servo ->
#      forward -> servo) while blocking. Fine for short/simple robots.
#   2) matching_id() + mark_triggered() + rotate_to_trigger()/rotate_to_home() -
#      fine-grained API. The caller runs the approach/forward steps in its OWN
#      per-frame loop (still scanning for ArUco every frame) - so an important
#      marker (e.g. a grid navigation node) is never MISSED during that drive.
#      FRODO's grid navigation uses this second approach (see
#      art_project_frodo.py's SERVO_APPROACHING/SERVO_ADVANCING states) - in
#      the field, check_and_run()'s ~4s "blind" block caused the robot to miss
#      the next grid marker (its acceptance window is narrow in size/position)
#      and navigate to the wrong spot.
